    Time views for one PyG batch.

    KLDM uses one diffusion time per material/crystal graph. A PyG batch packs
    many materials together, so the same material time must be reshaped for the
    branches that operate at different levels.

    graph:
        [G, 1], used by the score network.

    lattice:
        [G], same time squeezed, used by the lattice diffusion.

    nodes:
        [N], graph time copied to each atom/node, used by TDM.

    Example:
        graph = [[0.2],
                 [0.8]]

        batch.batch = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

        nodes = [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.8, 0.8]
